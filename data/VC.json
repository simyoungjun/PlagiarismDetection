A subset of VT, Voice conversion (VC) specifically aims to change a source speaker\u2019s speech in such a way that the generated output is perceived as a sentence uttered by a target speaker. Despite many years of research, VC systems still exhibit deficiencies in accurately mimicking a target speaker spectrally and prosodically, and simultaneously maintaining high speech quality.

In voice conversion, we change the speaker identity from one to another, while keeping the linguistic content unchanged. Voice conversion involves multiple speech processing techniques, such as speech analysis, spectral conversion, prosody conversion, speaker characterization, and vocoding. With the recent advances in theory and practice, we are now able to produce human-like voice quality with high speaker similarity. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art of voice conversion techniques and their performance evaluation methods from the statistical approaches to deep learning, and discuss their promise and limitations. We will also report the recent Voice Conversion Challenges (VCC), the performance of the current state of technology, and provide a summary of the available resources for voice conversion research."

        "content": "Voice conversion, as considered in this paper, is defined as modifying the speech signal of one speaker (source speaker) so that it sounds as if it had been pronounced by a different speaker (target speaker). Our contribution includes the design of a new methodology for representing the relationship between two sets of spectral envelopes. The proposed method is based on the use of a Gaussian mixture model of the source speaker spectral envelopes. The conversion itself is represented by a continuous parametric function which takes into account the probabilistic classification provided by the mixture model. The parameters of the conversion function are estimated by least squares optimization on the training data. This conversion method is implemented in the context of the HNM (harmonic+noise model) system, which allows high-quality modifications of speech signals. Compared to earlier methods based on vector quantization, the proposed conversion scheme results in a much better match between the converted envelopes and the target envelopes. Evaluation by objective tests and formal listening tests shows that the proposed transform greatly improves the quality and naturalness of the converted speech signals compared with previous proposed conversion methods."

This is important but challenging owing to the requirement of learning multiple mappings and the non-availability of explicit supervision. Recently, StarGAN-VC has garnered attention owing to its ability to solve this problem only using a single generator. However, there is still a gap between real and converted speech. To bridge this gap, we rethink conditional methods of StarGAN-VC, which are key components for achieving non-parallel multi-domain VC in a single model, and propose an improved variant called StarGAN-VC2. Particularly, we rethink conditional methods in two aspects: training objectives and network architectures. For the former, we propose a source-and-target conditional adversarial loss that allows all source domain data to be convertible to the target domain data. For the latter, we introduce a modulation-based conditional method that can transform the modulation of the acoustic feature in a domain-specific manner. We evaluated our methods on non-parallel multi-speaker VC. An objective evaluation demonstrates that our proposed methods improve speech quality in terms of both global and local structure measures. Furthermore, a subjective evaluation shows that StarGAN-VC2 outperforms StarGAN-VC in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity.

It is applied to a residual-excited LPC text-to-speech diphone synthesizer. Spectral parameters are mapped using a locally linear transformation based on Gaussian mixture models whose parameters are trained by joint density estimation. The LPC residuals are adjusted to match the target speakers average pitch. To study effects of the amount of training on performance, data sets of varying sizes are created by automatically selecting subsets of all available diphones by a vector quantization method. In an objective evaluation, the proposed method is found to perform more reliably for small training sets than a previous approach. In perceptual tests, it was shown that nearly optimal spectral conversion performance was achieved, even with a small amount of training data. However, speech quality improved with increases in the training set size."

        "content": "In this paper, we describe a novel spectral conversion method for voice conversion (VC). A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the joint probability density of source and target features is employed for performing spectral conversion between speakers. The conventional method converts spectral parameters frame by frame based on the minimum mean square error. Although it is reasonably effective, the deterioration of speech quality is caused by some problems: 1) appropriate spectral movements are not always caused by the frame-based conversion process, and 2) the converted spectra are excessively smoothed by statistical modeling. In order to address those problems, we propose a conversion method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation of a spectral parameter trajectory. Not only static but also dynamic feature statistics are used for realizing the appropriate converted spectrum sequence. Moreover, the oversmoothing effect is alleviated by considering a global variance feature of the converted spectra. Experimental results indicate that the performance of VC can be dramatically improved by the proposed method in view of both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality."

In this paper, we also address the issue of dependency of voice conversion techniques on parallel data between the source and the target speakers. While there have been efforts to use nonparallel data and speaker adaptation techniques, it is important to investigate techniques which capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker, and avoid any need for source speaker's data either for training or for adaptation. In this paper, we propose a voice conversion approach using an ANN model to capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker and demonstrate that such a voice conversion approach can perform monolingual as well as cross-lingual voice conversion of an arbitrary source speaker."

        "content": "Any modification applied to speech signals has an impact on their perceptual quality. In particular, voice conversion to modify a source voice so that it is perceived as a specific target voice involves prosodic and spectral transformations that produce significant quality degradation. Choosing among the current voice conversion methods represents a trade-off between the similarity of the converted voice to the target voice and the quality of the resulting converted speech, both rated by listeners. This paper presents a new voice conversion method termed Weighted Frequency Warping that has a good balance between similarity and quality. This method uses a time-varying piecewise-linear frequency warping function and an energy correction filter, and it combines typical probabilistic techniques and frequency warping transformations. Compared to standard probabilistic systems, Weighted Frequency Warping results in a significant increase in quality scores, whereas the conversion scores remain almost unaltered. This paper carefully discusses the theoretical aspects of the method and the details of its implementation, and the results of an international evaluation of the new system are also included."

Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based conversion is commonly used, but it is subject to overfitting. In this paper, we propose to use partial least squares (PLS)-based transforms in voice conversion. To prevent overfitting, the degrees of freedom in the mapping can be controlled by choosing a suitable number of components. We propose a technique to combine PLS with GMMs, enabling the use of multiple local linear mappings. To further improve the perceptual quality of the mapping where rapid transitions between GMM components produce audible artefacts, we propose to low-pass filter the component posterior probabilities. The conducted experiments show that the proposed technique results in better subjective and objective quality than the baseline joint density GMM approach. In speech quality conversion preference tests, the proposed method achieved 67% preference score against the smoothed joint density GMM method and 84% preference score against the unsmoothed joint density GMM method. In objective tests the proposed method produced a lower Mel-cepstral distortion than the reference methods."

We adopt the convolutional and recurrent neural network models to build a mean opinion score (MOS) predictor, termed as MOSNet. The proposed models are tested on large-scale listening test results of the Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018. Experimental results show that the predicted scores of the proposed MOSNet are highly correlated with human MOS ratings at the system level while being fairly correlated with human MOS ratings at the utterance level. Meanwhile, we have modified MOSNet to predict the similarity scores, and the preliminary results show that the predicted scores are also fairly correlated with human ratings. These results confirm that the proposed models could be used as a computational evaluator to measure the MOS of VC systems to reduce the need for expensive human rating."

Recently, CycleGAN-VC has provided a breakthrough and performed comparably to a parallel VC method without relying on any extra data, modules, or time alignment procedures. However, there is still a large gap between the real target and converted speech, and bridging this gap remains a challenge. To reduce the gap, we propose CycleGAN-VC2, which is an improved version of CycleGAN-VC incorporating three new techniques: an improved objective (two-step adversarial losses), improved generator (2-1-2D CNN), and improved discriminator (PatchGAN). We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task and analyzed the effect of each technique in detail. An objective evaluation showed that these techniques help bring the converted feature sequence closer to the target in terms of both global and local structures, which we assess by using Mel-cepstral distortion and modulation spectra distance, respectively.

At the conversion stage, acoustic features and durations of source utterances are converted simultaneously using the unified acoustic model. Mel-scale spectrograms are adopted as acoustic features, which contain both excitation and vocal tract descriptions of speech signals. The bottleneck features extracted from source speech using an automatic speech recognition model are appended as an auxiliary input. A WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel-spectrograms is built to reconstruct waveforms from the outputs of the SCENT model. It is worth noting that our proposed method can achieve appropriate duration conversion, which is difficult in conventional methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtained better objective and subjective performance than the baseline methods using Gaussian mixture models and deep neural networks as acoustic models.

Unsupervised adaptation of the EV-GMM is available to construct the conversion model for arbitrary target speakers in one-to-many VC or arbitrary source speakers in many-to-one VC using only a small amount of their speech data.

This study focuses on formulating robust techniques for a codebook mapping based voice conversion algorithm. Three different methods are used to improve voice conversion performance: confidence measures, pre-emphasis, and spectral equalization. Analysis is performed for each method and the implementation details are discussed. The first method employs confidence measures in the training stage to eliminate problematic pairs of source and target speech units that might result from possible misalignments, speaking style differences or pronunciation variations. Four confidence measures are developed based on the spectral distance, fundamental frequency (f0) distance, energy distance, and duration distance between the source and target speech units. The second method focuses on the importance of pre-emphasis in line-spectral frequency (LSF) based vocal tract modeling and transformation. The last method, spectral equalization, is aimed at reducing the differences in the source and target long-term spectra when the source and target recording conditions are significantly different. The voice conversion algorithm that employs the proposed techniques is compared with the baseline voice conversion algorithm with objective tests as well as three subjective listening tests. First, similarity to the target voice is evaluated in a subjective listening test and it is shown that the proposed algorithm improves similarity to the target voice by 23.0%. An ABX test is performed and the proposed algorithm is preferred over the baseline algorithm by 76.4%. In the third test, the two algorithms are compared in terms of the subjective quality of the voice conversion output.

The idea is to bridge between speakers by means of Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPGs) obtained from a speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (SI-ASR) system. It is assumed that these PPGs can represent articulation of speech sounds in a speaker-normalized space and correspond to spoken content speaker-independently. The proposed approach first obtains PPGs of target speech. Then, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network (DBLSTM) structure is used to model the relationships between the PPGs and acoustic features of the target speech. To convert arbitrary source speech, we obtain its PPGs from the same SI-ASR and feed them into the trained DBLSTM for generating converted speech. Our approach has two main advantages: 1) no parallel training data is required; 2) a trained model can be applied to any other source speaker for a fixed target speaker (i.e., many-to-one conversion). Experiments show that our approach performs equally well or better than state-of-the-art systems in both speech quality and speaker similarity."

The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion. Careful comparisons and analysis among the proposed method and some conventional methods are presented in this paper.

However, in some practical situations, such as cross-lingual voice conversion, it is not possible to obtain such parallel utterances. With an aim towards increasing the versatility of current voice conversion systems, this paper proposes a new iterative alignment method that allows pairing phonetically equivalent acoustic vectors from nonparallel utterances from different speakers, even under cross-lingual conditions.

        "content": "An electrolarynx (EL) is a medical device that generates sound source signals to provide laryngectomees with a voice. In this article we focus on two problems of speech produced with an EL (EL speech). One problem is that EL speech is extremely unnatural and the other is that sound source signals with high energy are generated by an EL, and therefore, the signals often annoy surrounding people. To address these two problems, in this article we propose three speaking-aid systems that enhance three different types of EL speech signals: EL speech, EL speech using an air-pressure sensor (EL-air speech), and silent EL speech. The air-pressure sensor enables a laryngectomee to manipulate the F0 contours of EL speech using exhaled air that flows from the tracheostoma. Silent EL speech is produced with a new sound source unit that generates signals with extremely low energy. Our speaking-aid systems address the poor quality of EL speech using voice conversion (VC), which transforms acoustic features so that it appears as if the speech is uttered by another person. Our systems estimate spectral parameters, F0, and aperiodic components independently. The result of experimental evaluations demonstrates that the use of an air-pressure sensor dramatically improves F0 estimation accuracy. Moreover, it is revealed that the converted speech signals are preferred to source EL speech."

In this paper, we propose using a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) for nonparallel data-based VC training. A CycleGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) originally developed for unpaired image-to-image translation. A subjective evaluation of inter-gender conversion demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed a method based on the Merlin open source neural network speech synthesis system (a parallel VC system adapted for our setup) and a GAN-based parallel VC system. This is the first research to show that the performance of a nonparallel VC method can exceed that of state-of-the-art parallel VC methods."

        "content": "The objective of voice conversion algorithms is to modify the speech by a particular source speaker so that it sounds as if spoken by a different target speaker. Current conversion algorithms employ a training procedure, during which the same utterances spoken by both the source and target speakers are needed for deriving the desired conversion parameters. Such a (parallel) corpus, is often difficult or impossible to collect. Here, we propose an algorithm that relaxes this constraint, i.e., the training corpus does not necessarily contain the same utterances from both speakers. The proposed algorithm is based on speaker adaptation techniques, adapting the conversion parameters derived for a particular pair of speakers to a different pair, for which only a nonparallel corpus is available. We show that adaptation reduces the error obtained when simply applying the conversion parameters of one pair of speakers to another by a factor that can reach 30%. A speaker identification measure is also employed that more insightfully portrays the importance of adaptation, while listening tests confirm the success of our method. Both the objective and subjective tests employed, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable results with the ideal case when a parallel corpus is available."

The proposed method is general purpose, high quality, and parallel-data free and works without any extra data, modules, or alignment procedure. It also avoids over-smoothing, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods. Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from unpaired data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss contributes to reducing over-smoothing of the converted feature sequence. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a parallel-data-free VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based method under advantageous conditions with parallel and twice the amount of data."

Experiments show that DBLSTM-RNNs outperform DNNs where Mean Opinion Scores are 3.2 and 2.3 respectively.

A body-conductive microphone called nonaudible murmur (NAM) microphone is effectively used to detect very soft unvoiced speech such as NAM or a whispered voice while keeping speech sounds emitted outside almost inaudible. However, body-conducted unvoiced speech is difficult to use in human-to-human speech communication because it sounds unnatural and less intelligible owing to the acoustic change caused by body conduction. To address this issue, voice conversion (VC) methods from NAM to normal speech (NAM-to-Speech) and to a whispered voice (NAM-to-Whisper) are proposed, where the acoustic features of body-conducted unvoiced speech are converted into those of natural voices in a probabilistic manner using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Moreover, these methods are extended to convert not only NAM but also a body-conducted whispered voice (BCW) as another type of body-conducted unvoiced speech. Several experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that 1) NAM-to-Speech effectively improves intelligibility but it causes degradation of naturalness owing to the difficulty of estimating natural fundamental frequency contours from unvoiced speech; 2) NAM-to-Whisper significantly outperforms NAM-to-Speech in terms of both intelligibility and naturalness; and 3) a single conversion model capable of converting both NAM and BCW is effectively developed in our proposed VC methods."

To establish the level of human performance as a baseline, we first measure the ability of listeners to discriminate between original speech utterances under three conditions: normal, fundamental frequency and duration normalized, and LPC coded. Additionally, the spectral parameter conversion function is tested in isolation by listening to source, target, and converted speakers as LPC coded speech. The results show that the speaker identity of speech whose LPC spectrum has been converted can be recognized as the target speaker with the same level of performance as discriminating between LPC coded speech. However, the level of discrimination of converted utterances produced by the full VC system is significantly below that of speaker discrimination of natural speech."

The proposed network employs a single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on.

We argue that VC models initialized with such pretrained ASR or TTS model parameters can generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech.

Nonetheless, the improved conversion technologies also led to concerns about privacy and authentication. It thus becomes highly desired to be able to prevent one's voice from being improperly utilized with such voice conversion technologies. This is why we report in this paper the first known attempt to perform adversarial attack on voice conversion. We introduce human imperceptible noise into the utterances of a speaker whose voice is to be defended. Given these adversarial examples, voice conversion models cannot convert other utterances so as to sound like being produced by the defended speaker. Preliminary experiments were conducted on two currently state-of-the-art zero-shot voice conversion models. Objective and subjective evaluation results in both white-box and black-box scenarios are reported. It was shown that the speaker characteristics of the converted utterances were made obviously different from those of the defended speaker, while the adversarial examples of the defended speaker are not distinguishable from the authentic utterances."

In addition, many of them ignore the inherent time-dependency between speech features. To address these issues, we propose to use dynamic kernel partial least squares (DKPLS) technique to model nonlinearities as well as to capture the dynamics in the data. The method is based on a kernel transformation of the source features to allow non-linear modeling and concatenation of previous and next frames to model the dynamics. Partial least squares regression is used to find a conversion function that does not overfit to the data. The resulting DKPLS algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm and does not require massive tuning. Existing statistical methods proposed for voice conversion are able to produce good similarity between the original and the converted target voices but the quality is usually degraded. The experiments conducted on a variety of conversion pairs show that DKPLS, being a statistical method, enables successful identity conversion while achieving a major improvement in the quality scores compared to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture-based model. In addition to enabling better spectral feature transformation, quality is further improved when aperiodicity and binary voicing values are converted using DKPLS with auxiliary information from spectral features."

Generative models focus on explaining the observations with latent variables instead of learning a pairwise transformation function, thereby bypassing the requirement of speech frame alignment. In this paper, we propose a non-parallel VC framework with a variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN) that explicitly considers a VC objective when building the speech model. Experimental results corroborate the capability of our framework for building a VC system from unaligned data, and demonstrate improved conversion quality."

The framework comprises an encoder that learns speaker-independent phonetic representations and a decoder that learns to reconstruct the designated speaker. It removes the requirement of parallel corpora or phonetic alignments to train a spectral conversion system.

In this paper, we proposed a novel one-shot VC approach which is able to perform VC by only an example utterance from source and target speaker respectively, and the source and target speaker do not even need to be seen during training. This is achieved by disentangling speaker and content representations with instance normalization (IN).

We note that speaker identity is also characterized by the prosody features such as fundamental frequency (F0), energy contour and duration. Motivated by this, we propose a framework that can perform F0, energy contour and duration conversion. In the traditional exemplar-based sparse representation approach to voice conversion, a general source-target dictionary of exemplars is constructed to establish the correspondence between source and target speakers. In this work, we propose a Phonetically Aware Sparse Representation of fundamental frequency and energy contour by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Our idea is motivated by the facts that CWT decompositions of F0 and energy contours describe prosody patterns in different temporal scales and allow for effective prosody manipulation in speech synthesis. Furthermore, phonetically aware exemplars lead to better estimation of activation matrix, therefore, possibly better conversion of prosody. We also propose a phonetically aware duration conversion framework which takes into account both phone-level and sentence-level speaking rates. We report that the proposed prosody conversion outperforms the traditional prosody conversion techniques in both objective and subjective evaluations."

Currently, standard VC approaches use Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based transformations that do not generate high-quality converted speech due to \u201cover-smoothing\u201d resulting from weak links between individual source and target frame parameters. Dynamic Frequency Warping (DFW) offers an appealing alternative to GMM-based methods, as more spectral details are maintained in transformation; however, the speaker timbre is less successfully converted because spectral power is not adjusted explicitly. Previous work combines separate GMM- and DFW-transformed spectral envelopes for each frame. This paper proposes a more effective DFW-based approach that (1) does not rely on the baseline GMM methods, and (2) functions on the acoustic class level. To adjust spectral power, an amplitude scaling function is used that compares the average target and warped source log spectra for each acoustic class. The proposed DFW with Amplitude scaling (DFWA) outperforms standard GMM and hybrid GMM-DFW methods for VC in terms of both speech quality and timbre conversion, as is confirmed in extensive objective and subjective testing. Furthermore, by not requiring time-alignment of source and target speech, DFWA is able to perform equally well using parallel or nonparallel corpora, as is demonstrated explicitly."

In this paper, we investigate anonymization methods based on voice conversion. In contrast to prior work, we argue that various linkage attacks can be designed depending on the attackers' knowledge about the anonymization scheme. We compare two frequency warping-based conversion methods and a deep learning based method in three attack scenarios. The utility of converted speech is measured via the word error rate achieved by automatic speech recognition, while privacy protection is assessed by the increase in equal error rate achieved by state-of-the-art i-vector or x-vector based speaker verification.

The proposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a model with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks. Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle any-to-many conversion tasks. Third, we introduce a mechanism, called the conditional batch normalization that switches batch normalization layers in accordance with the target speaker. This particular mechanism has been found to be extremely effective for our many-to-many conversion model. We conducted speaker identity conversion experiments and found that ConvS2S-VC obtained higher sound quality and speaker similarity than baseline methods.

Our method, called CycleGAN-VC, uses a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) with gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an identity-mapping loss. A CycleGAN learns forward and inverse mappings simultaneously using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. This makes it possible to find an optimal pseudo pair from non-parallel data. Furthermore, the adversarial loss can bring the converted speech close to the target one on the basis of indistinguishability without explicit density estimation. This allows to avoid over-smoothing caused by statistical averaging, which occurs in many conventional statistical model-based VC methods that represent data distribution explicitly. We configure a CycleGAN with gated CNNs and train it with an identity-mapping loss. This allows the mapping function to capture sequential and hierarchical structures while preserving linguistic information. We evaluated our method on a non-parallel VC task. An objective evaluation showed that the converted feature sequence was near natural in terms of global variance and modulation spectra, which are structural indicators highly correlated with subjective evaluation. A subjective evaluation showed that the quality of the converted speech was comparable to that obtained with a Gaussian mixture model-based parallel VC method even though CycleGAN-VC is trained under disadvantageous conditions (non-parallel and half the amount of data)."

Recently, many works have focused on disentangle-based learning techniques to separate the timbre and the linguistic content information from a speech signal. Once successful, voice conversion will be feasible and straightforward. This paper proposed a novel one-shot voice conversion framework based on vector quantization voice conversion (VQVC) and AutoVC, called AVQVC.

In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework for voice conversion, with which a single model can be trained to convert the voice to many different speakers, all without parallel data, by separating the speaker characteristics from the linguistic content in speech signals. An autoencoder is first trained to extract speaker-independent latent representations and speaker embedding separately using another auxiliary speaker classifier to regularize the latent representation. The decoder then takes the speaker-independent latent representation and the target speaker embedding as the input to generate the voice of the target speaker with the linguistic content of the source utterance. The quality of decoder output is further improved by patching with the residual signal produced by another pair of generator and discriminator. A target speaker set size of 20 was tested in the preliminary experiments, and very good voice quality was obtained. Conventional voice conversion metrics are reported. We also show that the speaker information has been properly reduced from the latent representations."

Converted speech is produced by a basic LP analysis of the source and LP synthesis using the converted spectral envelopes. We compared three types of conversion: without mapping, with mapping and using the excitation of the source speaker and finally with mapping using the excitation of the target. Results show that the combination of mapping and frame selection provide the best results, and underline the interest to work on methods to convert the LP excitation."

FragmentVC utilizes two encoders to encode source and target information and adopts cross attention to align the source and target features with similar phonetic content. Moreover, pre-trained features are adopted. AUTOVC used dvector to extract speaker information, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features like wav2vec 2.0 is used in FragmentVC to extract the phonetic content information. Different from previous works, we proposed S2VC that utilizes Self-Supervised features as both source and target features for VC model. Supervised phoneme posteriororgram (PPG), which is believed to be speaker-independent and widely used in VC to extract content information, is chosen as a strong baseline for SSL features. The objective evaluation and subjective evaluation both show models taking SSL feature CPC as both source and target features outperforms that taking PPG as source feature, suggesting that SSL features have great potential in improving VC."

The linear combination weights are constrained to be sparse to avoid over-smoothing, and high-resolution spectra are employed in the exemplars directly without dimensionality reduction to maintain spectral details. In addition, a spectral compression factor and a residual compensation technique are included in the framework to enhance the conversion performances. We conducted experiments on the VOICES database to compare the proposed method with a large set of state-of-the-art baseline methods, including the maximum likelihood Gaussian mixture model (ML-GMM) with dynamic feature constraint and the partial least squares (PLS) regression based methods. The experimental results show that the objective spectral distortion of ML-GMM is reduced from 5.19 dB to 4.92 dB, and both the subjective mean opinion score and the speaker identification rate are increased from 2.49 and 73.50% to 3.15 and 79.50%, respectively, by the proposed method.

It is one of the most expressive components in music and a means of entertainment as well as self expression. In this paper, we propose a novel singing voice conversion framework, that is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed GAN-based conversion framework, that we call SINGAN, consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and converted singing voice, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. With GAN, we minimize the differences of the distributions between the original target parameters and the generated singing parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first framework that uses generative adversarial networks for singing voice conversion. In experiments, we show that the proposed method effectively converts singing voices and outperforms the baseline approach."

Auto-encoder-based VC methods disentangle the speaker and the content in input speech without given the speaker's identity, so these methods can further generalize to unseen speakers. The disentangle capability is achieved by vector quantization (VQ), adversarial training, or instance normalization (IN). However, the imperfect disentanglement may harm the quality of output speech. In this work, to further improve audio quality, we use the U-Net architecture within an auto-encoder-based VC system. We find that to leverage the U-Net architecture, a strong information bottleneck is necessary. The VQ-based method, which quantizes the latent vectors, can serve the purpose.

        "content": "The basic goal of the voice conversion system is to modify the speaker-specific characteristics, keeping the message and the environmental information contained in the speech signal intact. Speaker characteristics reflect in speech at different levels, such as, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation source characteristics), the shape of the vocal tract (vocal tract system characteristics) and the long-term features (suprasegmental or prosodic characteristics). In this paper, we are proposing neural network models for developing mapping functions at each level. The features used for developing the mapping functions are extracted using pitch synchronous analysis. Pitch synchronous analysis provides the estimation of accurate vocal tract parameters, by analyzing the speech signal independently in each pitch period without influenced by the adjacent pitch cycles. In this work, the instants of significant excitation are used as pitch markers to perform the pitch synchronous analysis. The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. In this paper, line spectral frequencies (LSFs) are used for representing the vocal tract characteristics, and for developing its associated mapping function. LP residual of the speech signal is viewed as excitation source, and the residual samples around the instant of glottal closure are used for mapping. Prosodic parameters at syllable and phrase levels are used for deriving the mapping function. Source and system level mapping functions are derived pitch synchronously, and the incorporation of target prosodic parameters is performed pitch synchronously using instants of significant excitation. The performance of the voice conversion system is evaluated using listening tests. The prediction accuracy of the mapping functions (neural network models) used at different levels in the proposed voice conversion system is further evaluated using objective measures such as deviation (\nD\ni\n)\n, root mean square error (\n\u03bc\nRMSE\n) and correlation coefficient (\n\u03b3\nX\n,\nY\n). The proposed approach (i.e., mapping and modification of parameters using pitch synchronous approach) used for voice conversion is shown to be performed better compared to the earlier method (mapping the vocal tract parameters using block processing) proposed by the author."

The proposed method has two key features. First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture the time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target speech. Second, it uses information-theoretic regularization for the model training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not be lost in the conversion process. With regular conditional VAEs, the encoder and decoder are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs are correctly predicted by the classifier. We also present several ways to convert the feature sequence of input speech using the trained encoder and decoder and compare them in terms of audio quality through objective and subjective evaluations. We confirmed experimentally that the proposed method outperformed baseline non-parallel VC systems and performed comparably to an open-source parallel VC system trained using a parallel corpus in a speaker identity conversion task."

In this work, we investigate a robust transformation function for voice conversion using conditional restricted Boltzmann machine. Conditional restricted Boltzmann machine, which performs linear and non-linear transformations simultaneously, is proposed to learn the relationship between source and target speech. CMU ARCTIC corpus is adopted in the experimental validations. The number of parallel training utterances is varied from 2 to 40.

Conventional VC using shared context posterior probabilities predicts target speech parameters from the context posterior probabilities estimated from the source speech parameters. Although conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further, we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the conventional VC."

The proposed system uses the shape of the vocal tract, the shape of the glottal pulse (excitation signal) and long term prosodic features to carry out the voice conversion task. In this paper, the shape of the vocal tract and the shape of source excitation of a particular speaker are represented using Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs) and Linear Prediction (LP) residual respectively. GRNN is used to obtain the mapping function between the source and target speakers. The direct transformation of the time domain residual using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) causes phase change and generates artifacts in consecutive frames. In order to alleviate it, wavelet packet decomposed coefficients are used to characterize the excitation of the speech signal. The long term prosodic parameters namely, pitch contour (intonation) and the energy profile of the test signal are also modified in relation to that of the target (desired) speaker using the baseline method. The relative performances of the proposed model are compared to voice conversion system based on the state of the art RBF and GMM models using objective and subjective evaluation measures.

We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker independent context vectors, thus re-purpose such a mapping to supervise the training of the latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as the input, while the decoder is functionally similar to the TTS decoder. As we condition the decoder on a speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own encoder-decoder architecture without the need of text input.

Second, an adversarial training strategy is employed to further wipe out speaker information from the linguistic representations. Meanwhile, speaker representations are extracted from audio signals by a speaker encoder. The model parameters are estimated by two-stage training, including a pre-training stage using a multi-speaker dataset and a fine-tuning stage using the dataset of a specific conversion pair. Since both the recognition encoder and the decoder for recovering acoustic features are seq2seq neural networks, there are no constrains of frame alignment and frame-by-frame conversion in our proposed method. Experimental results showed that our method obtained higher similarity and naturalness than the best non-parallel voice conversion method in Voice Conversion Challenge 2018. Besides, the performance of our proposed method was closed to the state-of-the-art parallel seq2seq voice conversion method."

Compared with conventional frame-to-frame voice conversion approaches, the seq2seq acoustic modeling method proposed in our previous work achieved higher naturalness and similarity. In this paper, we further improve its performance by utilizing the text transcriptions of parallel training data. First, a multi-task learning structure is designed which adds auxiliary classifiers to the middle layers of the seq2seq model and predicts linguistic labels as a secondary task. Second, a data-augmentation method is proposed which utilizes text alignment to produce extra parallel sequences for model training. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed method with training sets at different sizes. Experimental results show that the multi-task learning with linguistic labels is effective at reducing the errors of seq2seq voice conversion. The data-augmentation method can further improve the performance of seq2seq voice conversion when only 50 or 100 training utterances are available."

This paper investigates voice conversion and modification techniques to reduce database collection and processing efforts while maintaining acceptable quality and naturalness. In a factorial design, we study the relative contributions of voice quality and prosody as well as the amount of distortions introduced by the respective signal manipulation steps. The unit selection engine in our open source and modular text-to-speech (TTS) framework MARY is extended with voice quality transformation using either GMM-based prediction or vocal tract copy resynthesis. These algorithms are then cross-combined with various prosody copy resynthesis methods. The overall expressive speech generation process functions as a postprocessing step on TTS outputs to transform neutral synthetic speech into aggressive, cheerful, or depressed speech. Cross-combinations of voice quality and prosody transformation algorithms are compared in listening tests for perceived expressive style and quality. The results show that there is a tradeoff between identification and naturalness. Combined modeling of both voice quality and prosody leads to the best identification scores at the expense of lowest naturalness ratings. The fine detail of both voice quality and prosody, as preserved by the copy synthesis, did contribute to a better identification as compared to the approximate models."

One RTRBM is used for each speaker, with the goal of capturing high-order temporal dependencies in an acoustic sequence. Our algorithm starts from the separate training of one RTRBM for a source speaker and another for a target speaker using speaker-dependent training data. Because each RTRBM attempts to discover abstractions to maximally express the training data at each time step, as well as the temporal dependencies in the training data, we expect that the models represent the linguistic-related latent features in high-order spaces. In our approach, we convert (match) features of emphasis for the source speaker to those of the target speaker using a neural network (NN), so that the entire network (consisting of the two RTRBMs and the NN) acts as a deep recurrent NN and can be fine-tuned. Using VC experiments, we confirm the high performance of our method, especially in terms of objective criteria, relative to conventional VC methods such as approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and on NNs."

In this approach, we combine a bottle-neck feature extractor (BNE) with a seq2seq synthesis module. During the training stage, an encoder-decoder-based hybrid connectionist-temporal-classification-attention (CTC-attention) phoneme recognizer is trained, whose encoder has a bottle-neck layer. A BNE is obtained from the phoneme recognizer and is utilized to extract speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity. Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and subjective evaluations."

A conversion method is considered successful when the produced speech sounds natural and similar to the target speaker. This paper presents a new voice conversion framework in which we combine frequency warping and exemplar-based method for voice conversion. Our method maintains high-resolution details during conversion by directly applying frequency warping on the high-resolution spectrum to represent the target. The warping function is generated by a sparse interpolation from a dictionary of exemplar warping functions. As the generated warping function is dependent only on a very small set of exemplars, we do away with the statistical averaging effects inherited from Gaussian mixture models. To compensate for the conversion error, we also apply residual exemplars into the conversion process. Both objective and subjective evaluations on the VOICES database validated the effectiveness of the proposed voice conversion framework. We observed a significant improvement in speech quality over the state-of-the-art parametric methods."

Cycle-consistent adversarial network-based VCs (CycleGAN-VC and CycleGAN-VC2) are widely accepted as benchmark methods. However, owing to their insufficient ability to grasp time-frequency structures, their application is limited to mel-cepstrum conversion and not mel-spectrogram conversion despite recent advances in mel-spectrogram vocoders. To overcome this, CycleGAN-VC3, an improved variant of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates an additional module called time-frequency adaptive normalization (TFAN), has been proposed. However, an increase in the number of learned parameters is imposed. As an alternative, we propose MaskCycleGAN-VC, which is another extension of CycleGAN-VC2 and is trained using a novel auxiliary task called filling in frames (FIF). With FIF, we apply a temporal mask to the input mel-spectrogram and encourage the converter to fill in missing frames based on surrounding frames. This task allows the converter to learn time-frequency structures in a self-supervised manner and eliminates the need for an additional module such as TFAN. A subjective evaluation of the naturalness and speaker similarity showed that MaskCycleGAN-VC outperformed both CycleGAN-VC2 and CycleGAN-VC3 with a model size similar to that of CycleGAN-VC2.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

Previous works focus on reducing the dimension of speech to get the content information. But the size is hard to determine to lead to the untangle overlapping problem. We propose the Disentangled Representation Voice Conversion (DRVC) model to address the issue. DRVC model is an end-to-end self-supervised model consisting of the content encoder, timbre encoder, and generator. Instead of the previous work for reducing speech size to get content, we propose a cycle for restricting the disentanglement by the Cycle Reconstruct Loss and Same Loss.

        "content": "In this paper, we present a novel technique for a non-parallel voice conversion (VC) with the use of cyclic variational autoencoder (CycleVAE)-based spectral modeling. In a variational autoencoder(VAE) framework, a latent space, usually with a Gaussian prior, is used to encode a set of input features. In a VAE-based VC, the encoded latent features are fed into a decoder, along with speaker-coding features, to generate estimated spectra with either the original speaker identity (reconstructed) or another speaker identity (converted). Due to the non-parallel modeling condition, the converted spectra can not be directly optimized, which heavily degrades the performance of a VAE-based VC. In this work, to overcome this problem, we propose to use CycleVAE-based spectral model that indirectly optimizes the conversion flow by recycling the converted features back into the system to obtain corresponding cyclic reconstructed spectra that can be directly optimized. The cyclic flow can be continued by using the cyclic reconstructed features as input for the next cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CycleVAE-based VC, which yields higher accuracy of converted spectra, generates latent features with higher correlation degree, and significantly improves the quality and conversion accuracy of the converted speech."

For this reason, VC is generally ill-suited for accent-conversion (AC) purposes, where the goal is to capture the regional accent of the source while preserving the voice quality of the target. In this paper, we propose a modification of the conventional training process for VC that allows it to perform as an AC transform. Namely, we pair source and target vectors based not on their ordering within a parallel corpus, as is commonly done in VC, but based on their linguistic similarity. We validate the approach on a corpus containing native-accented and Spanish-accented utterances, and compare it against conventional VC through a series of listening tests. We also analyze whether phonological differences between the two languages (Spanish and American English) help predict the performance of the two methods."

Mapping of the intonation patterns (pitch contour) is carried out using a codebook based model at segmental level. The energy profile of the signal is modified using a fixed scaling factor defined between the source and target speakers at the segmental level. Two different methods for residual modification such as residual copying and residual selection methods are used to generate the target residual signal.

With parallel training data, we found that phonetic sub-dictionary outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in objective and subjective evaluations.

Many VC systems use disentangle-based learning techniques to separate the speaker and the linguistic content information from a speech signal. Subsequently, they convert the voice by changing the speaker information to that of the target speaker. To prevent the speaker information from leaking into the content embeddings, previous works either reduce the dimension or quantize the content embedding as a strong information bottleneck. These mechanisms somehow hurt the synthesis quality. In this work, we propose AGAIN-VC, an innovative VC system using Activation Guidance and Adaptive Instance Normalization. AGAIN-VC is an auto-encoder-based model, comprising of a single encoder and a decoder. With a proper activation as an information bottleneck on content embeddings, the trade-off between the synthesis quality and the speaker similarity of the converted speech is improved drastically. This one-shot VC system obtains the best performance regardless of the subjective or objective evaluations."

To solve this, the proposed method adopts a sequence-to-sequence network with an attention module that enables the network to learn attention in the neutral input sequence should be focused on which part of the emotional output sequence. Besides, to capture the multi-attribute aspects of emotional variations, an emotion encoder is designed for transforming acoustic features into emotion embedding vectors. By aggregating the emotion embedding vectors for each emotion, a representative vector for the target emotion is obtained and weighted to reflect emotion strength. By introducing a speaker encoder, the proposed method can preserve speaker identity even after the emotion conversion. Objective and subjective evaluation results confirm that the proposed method is superior to other previous works. Especially, in emotion strength control, we achieve in getting successful results."

These methods modify the frequency axis of the source spectrum in such manner that some significant parts of it, usually the formants, are moved towards their image in the target speaker's spectrum. Amplitude scaling is then applied to compensate for the differences between warped source spectra and target spectra. This article presents a fully parametric formulation of a frequency warping plus amplitude scaling method in which bilinear frequency warping functions are used. Introducing this constraint allows for the conversion error to be described in the cepstral domain and to minimize it with respect to the parameters of the transformation through an iterative algorithm, even when multiple overlapping conversion classes are considered. The paper explores the advantages and limitations of this approach when applied to a cepstral representation of speech. We show that it achieves significant improvements in quality with respect to traditional methods based on Gaussian mixture models, with no loss in average conversion accuracy. Despite its relative simplicity, it achieves similar performance scores to state-of-the-art statistical methods involving dynamic features and global variance."
