The response of knowledge grounded conversation might contain multiple answer entities or no entity at all. Although existing generative question answering (QA) systems can be applied to knowledge grounded conversation, they either have at most one entity in a response or cannot deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We propose a fully data-driven generative dialogue system GenDS that is capable of generating responses based on input message and related knowledge base (KB). To generate arbitrary number of answer entities even when these entities never appear in the training set, we design a dynamic knowledge enquirer which selects different answer entities at different positions in a single response, according to different local context. It does not rely on the representations of entities, enabling our model deal with out-of-vocabulary entities. We collect a human-human conversation data (ConversMusic) with knowledge annotations. The proposed method is evaluated on CoversMusic and a public question answering dataset. Our proposed GenDS system outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of the BLEU, entity accuracy, entity recall and human evaluation. Moreover,the experiments also demonstrate that GenDS works better even on small datasets."

The current state of affairs suggests various evaluation protocols to assess chat-oriented dialogue management systems, rendering it difficult to conduct fair comparative studies across different approaches and gain an insightful understanding of their values. To foster this research, a more robust evaluation protocol must be set in place. This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of both automated and human evaluation methods on dialogue systems, identifying their shortcomings while accumulating evidence towards the most effective evaluation dimensions. A total of 20 papers from the last two years are surveyed to analyze three types of evaluation protocols: automated, static, and interactive. Finally, the evaluation dimensions used in these papers are compared against our expert evaluation on the system-user dialogue data collected from the Alexa Prize 2020."

GUS (Genial Understander System) is intended to engage a sympathetic and highly cooperative human in an English dialog, directed towards a specific goal within a very restricted domain of discourse. As a starting point, GUS was restricted to the role of a travel agent in a conversation with a client who wants to make a simple return trip to a single city in California.\nThere is good reason for restricting the domain of discourse for a computer system which is to engage in an English dialog. Specializing the subject matter that the system can talk about permits it to achieve some measure of realism without encompassing all the possibilities of human knowledge or of the English language. It also provides the user with specific motivation for participating in the conversation, thus narrowing the range of expectations that GUS must have about the user's purposes. A system restricted in this way will be more able to guide the conversation within the boundaries of its competence."

        "content": "Statistical dialog systems (SDSs) are motivated by the need for a data-driven framework that reduces the cost of laboriously handcrafting complex dialog managers and that provides robustness against the errors created by speech recognizers operating in noisy environments. By including an explicit Bayesian model of uncertainty and by optimizing the policy via a reward-driven process, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide such a framework. However, exact model representation and optimization is computationally intractable. Hence, the practical application of POMDP-based systems requires efficient algorithms and carefully constructed approximations. This review article provides an overview of the current state of the art in the development of POMDP-based spoken dialog systems."

        "content": "In this paper, we present a statistical approach for the development of a dialog manager and for learning optimal dialog strategies. This methodology is based on a classification procedure that considers all of the previous history of the dialog to select the next system answer. To evaluate the performance of the dialog system, the statistical approach for dialog management has been extended to model the user behavior. The statistical user simulator has been used for the evaluation and improvement of the dialog strategy. Both the user model and the system model are automatically learned from a training corpus that is labeled in terms of dialog acts. New measures have been defined to evaluate the performance of the dialog system. Using these measures, we evaluate both the quality of the simulated dialogs and the improvement of the new dialog strategy that is obtained with the interaction of the two modules. This methodology has been applied to develop a dialog manager within the framework of the DIHANA project, whose goal is the design and development of a dialog system to access a railway information system using spontaneous speech in Spanish. We propose the use of corpus-based methodologies to develop the main modules in the dialog system."

More than one hundred male and female participants with 1st or non-1st English language, age range 13\u201364, interacted with the systems over the Internet scoring each for conversation ability. Developers of the modern conversation systems show they deploy a variety of techniques to initiate and maintain dialogue learning from interactions with humans over the Internet. Statistical significance shows these dialogue systems are an improvement on their predecessor. Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse. The uses of modern Elizas are proven successful as virtual assistants in e-commerce; their conversational basis is already extending into education. What we can say is modern artificial dialogue systems do talk. They are able to participate in conversation in a way their predecessor Eliza could not: they are able to share personal opinions, relay experience of family dramas, be relevant, but also be vague, and mislead just as humans do."

        "content": "In a spoken dialog system, determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses, local use of confidence scores, and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection, taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques, and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally, some of the key challenges to advancing this method \u2013 in particular scalability \u2013 are briefly outlined."

Popular methods for learning task-oriented dialogues include applying reinforcement learning with user feedback on supervised pre-training models. Efficiency of such learning method may suffer from the mismatch of dialogue state distribution between offline training and online interactive learning stages. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid imitation and reinforcement learning method, with which a dialogue agent can effectively learn from its interaction with users by learning from human teaching and feedback. We design a neural network based task-oriented dialogue agent that can be optimized end-to-end with the proposed learning method. Experimental results show that our end-to-end dialogue agent can learn effectively from the mistake it makes via imitation learning from user teaching. Applying reinforcement learning with user feedback after the imitation learning stage further improves the agent's capability in successfully completing a task."

        "content": "This paper describes the experimental setups and the evaluation results of the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC6) aiming to develop end-to-end dialogue systems. Neural network models have become a recent focus of investigation in dialogue technologies. Previous models required training data to be manually annotated with word meanings and dialogue states, but end-to-end neural network dialogue systems learn to directly output natural-language system responses without needing training data to be manually annotated. Thus, this approach allows us to scale up the size of training data and cover more dialog domains. In addition, dialogue systems require a meta-function to avoid deploying inappropriate responses generated by themselves. To challenge such issues, the DSTC6 consists of three tracks, (1). End-to-End Goal Oriented dialogue Learning to select system responses, (2). End-to-End Conversation Modeling to generate system responses using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and (3). Dialogue Breakdown Detection. Since each domain has different issues to be addressed to develop dialogue systems, we targeted restaurant retrieval dialogues to fill slot-value in Track 1, customer services on Twitter by combining goal-oriented dialogues and ChitChat in Track 2 and human-machine dialogue data for ChitChat in Track 3.\nDSTC6 had 141 people declaring their interests and 23 teams submitted their final results. 18 scientific papers were presented in the wrap-up workshop. We find the blending end-to-end trainable models associated to meaningful prior knowledge performs the best for the restaurant retrieval for Track 1. Indeed, Hybrid Code Network and Memory Network have been the best models for this task. In Track 2, 78.5% of the system responses automatically generated by the best system were rated better than acceptable by humans and this achieves 89% of the number of the human responses rated in the same class. In Track3, the dialogue breakdown detection technologies performed as well as human agreements, in both data-sets of English and Japanese."

        "content": "Recently there are increasing concerns about the fairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in real-world applications such as computer vision and recommendations. For example, recognition algorithms in computer vision are unfair to black people such as poorly detecting their faces and inappropriately identifying them as \"gorillas\". As one crucial application of AI, dialogue systems have been extensively applied in our society. They are usually built with real human conversational data; thus they could inherit some fairness issues which are held in the real world. However, the fairness of dialogue systems has not been well investigated. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study about the fairness issues in dialogue systems. In particular, we construct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand fairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue models show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides, to mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective debiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in dialogue systems significantly. The dataset and the implementation are released to foster fairness research in dialogue systems."

        "content": "Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system."

This paper presents a novel approach to error simulation based on statistical models for word-level utterance generation, ASR confusions, and confidence score generation. While the method explicitly models the context-dependent acoustic confusability of words and allows the system specific language model and semantic decoder to be incorporated, it is computationally inexpensive and thus potentially suitable for running thousands of training simulations. Experimental evaluation results with a POMDP-based dialogue system and the Hidden Agenda User Simulator indicate a close match between the statistical properties of real and synthetic errors."

Following reasonable procedures and using various support skills can help to effectively provide support. However, due to the lack of a well-designed task and corpora of effective emotional support conversations, research on building emotional support into dialog systems remains untouched. In this paper, we define the Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) task and propose an ESC Framework, which is grounded on the Helping Skills Theory. We construct an Emotion Support Conversation dataset (ESConv) with rich annotation (especially support strategy) in a help-seeker and supporter mode. To ensure a corpus of high-quality conversations that provide examples of effective emotional support, we take extensive effort to design training tutorials for supporters and several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art dialog models with respect to the ability to provide emotional support. Our results show the importance of support strategies in providing effective emotional support and the utility of ESConv in training more emotional support systems."

These experiments also served to evaluate the realism of simulated dialogues using two proposed metrics contrasted with \u2018Precision-Recall\u2019. The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model, and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour; (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy; and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems."

Most work on this area assumes text-based conversation, where the user message is modeled as a sequence of words in a vocabulary. Real-world human conversation, in contrast, involves other modalities, such as voice, facial expression and body language, which can influence the conversation significantly in certain scenarios. In this work, we explore the impact of incorporating the audio features of the user message into generative dialogue systems. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary response retrieval task for audio representation learning. Then, we use word-level modality fusion to incorporate the audio features as additional context to our main generative model. Experiments show that our audio-augmented model outperforms the audio-free counterpart on perplexity, response diversity and human evaluation."

In this paper, the utilization of embeddings for answer retrieval is explored by using Locality-Sensitive Hashing Forest (LSH Forest), an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) model, to find similar conversations in a corpus and rank possible candidates. Experimental results on the well-known Ubuntu Corpus (in English) and a customer service chat dataset (in Dutch) show that, in combination with a candidate selection method, retrieval-based approaches outperform generative ones and reveal promising future research directions towards the usability of such a system."

This problem can be mitigated if the user's intent is known in advance or data is available to pre-train a task success predictor off-line. In practice neither of these apply for most real world applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce data annotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning."

Previous models for user simulation suffer from several drawbacks, such as the inability to take dialogue history into account, the need of rigid structure to ensure coherent user behaviour, heavy dependence on a specific domain, the inability to output several user intentions during one dialogue turn, or the requirement of a summarized action space for tractability. This paper introduces a data-driven user simulator based on an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network. The model takes as input a sequence of dialogue contexts and outputs a sequence of dialogue acts corresponding to user intentions. The dialogue contexts include information about the machine acts and the status of the user goal. We show on the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset that the sequence-to-sequence model outperforms an agenda-based simulator and an n-gram simulator, according to F-score. Furthermore, we show how this model can be used on the original action space and thereby models user behaviour with finer granularity."

        "content": "This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which provides a well-founded, statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However, exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made, which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm.\nThe framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive, although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall, the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems."

        "content": "In recent years, a question of great interest has been the development of tools and techniques to facilitate the evaluation of dialogue systems. The latter can be evaluated from various points of view, such as recognition and understanding rates, dialogue naturalness and robustness against recognition errors. Evaluation usually requires compiling a large corpus of words and sentences uttered by users, relevant to the application domain the system is designed for. This paper proposes a new technique that makes it possible to reuse such a corpus for the evaluation and to check the performance of the system when different dialogue strategies are used. The technique is based on the automatic generation of conversations between the dialogue system, together with an additional dialogue system called user simulator that represents the user\u2019s interaction with the dialogue system. The technique has been applied to evaluate a dialogue system developed in our lab using two different recognition front-ends and two different dialogue strategies to handle user confirmations. The experiments show that the prompt-dependent recognition front-end achieves better results, but that this front-end is appropriate only if users limit their utterances to those related to the current system prompt. The prompt-independent front-end achieves inferior results, but enables front-end users to utter any permitted utterance at any time, irrespective of the system prompt. In consequence, this front-end may allow a more natural and comfortable interaction. The experiments also show that the re-prompting confirmation strategy enhances system performance for both recognition front-ends."

Finally, for Track 3, the best model used Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to combine the text and vision information obtaining a 22% better result than the baseline LSTM system for the human rating score.\nMore than 220 participants were registered and about 40 teams participated in the final challenge. 32 scientific papers reporting the systems submitted to DSTC7, and 3 general technical papers for dialog technologies, were presented during the one-day wrap-up workshop at AAAI-19.

We instantiate our learning framework with two pre-trained backbones: T5 and BART, and evaluate them on MultiWOZ. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) our systems establish new state-of-the-art results on end-to-end response generation, 2) MinTL-based systems are more robust than baseline methods in the low resource setting, and they achieve competitive results with only 20\\% training data, and 3) Lev greatly improves the inference efficiency."

        "content": "Designing task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging research topic, since it needs not only to generate utterances fulfilling user requests but also to guarantee the comprehensibility. Many previous works trained end-to-end (E2E) models with supervised learning (SL), however, the bias in annotated system utterances remains as a bottleneck. Reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when improving the performance on fulfilling user requests. In our work, we (1) propose modelling the hierarchical structure between dialogue policy and natural language generator (NLG) with the option framework, called HDNO, where the latent dialogue act is applied to avoid designing specific dialogue act representations; (2) train HDNO via hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), as well as suggest the asynchronous updates between dialogue policy and NLG during training to theoretically guarantee their convergence to a local maximizer; and (3) propose using a discriminator modelled with language models as an additional reward to further improve the comprehensibility. We test HDNO on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz 2.1, the datasets on multi-domain dialogues, in comparison with word-level E2E model trained with RL, LaRL and HDSA, showing improvements on the performance evaluated by automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation. Finally, we demonstrate the semantic meanings of latent dialogue acts to show the explanability for HDNO."

In addition, we show its transferring ability by simulating zero-shot and few-shot dialogue state tracking for unseen domains. TRADE achieves 60.58% joint goal accuracy in one of the zero-shot domains, and is able to adapt to few-shot cases without forgetting already trained domains."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01745",
        "content": "Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality. Most NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates. With fewer heuristics, an objective evaluation in two differing test domains showed the proposed method improved performance compared to previous methods. Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness and overall preferred it to the other systems."

        "content": "Recently a variety of LSTM-based conditional language models (LM) have been applied across a range of language generation tasks. In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used."

        "content": "Though recent end-to-end neural models have shown promising progress on Conversational Recommender System (CRS), two key challenges still remain. First, the recommended items cannot be always incorporated into the generated replies precisely and appropriately. Second, only the items mentioned in the training corpus have a chance to be recommended in the conversation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called NTRD for recommender dialogue system that decouples the dialogue generation from the item recommendation. NTRD has two key components, i.e., response template generator and item selector. The former adopts an encoder-decoder model to generate a response template with slot locations tied to target items, while the latter fills in slot locations with the proper items using a sufficient attention mechanism. Our approach combines the strengths of both classical slot filling approaches (that are generally controllable) and modern neural NLG approaches (that are generally more natural and accurate). Extensive experiments on the benchmark ReDial show our NTRD significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our approach has the unique advantage to produce novel items that do not appear in the training set of dialogue corpus. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/jokieleung/NTRD}."

In addition, we introduce a new dialogue multi-task pre-training strategy that allows the model to learn the primary TOD task completion skills from heterogeneous dialog corpora. We extensively test our model on three benchmark TOD tasks, including end-to-end dialogue modelling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. Experimental results show that PPTOD achieves new state of the art on all evaluated tasks in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, comparisons against previous SOTA methods show that the responses generated by PPTOD are more factually correct and semantically coherent as judged by human annotators."

In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL.

Moreover, we implement and compare multiple existing continual learning baselines, and we propose a simple yet effective architectural method based on residual adapters. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architectural method and a simple replay-based strategy perform comparably well but they both achieve inferior performance to the multi-task learning baseline, in where all the data are shown at once, showing that continual learning in task-oriented dialogue systems is a challenging task. Furthermore, we reveal several trade-offs between different continual learning methods in term of parameter usage and memory size, which are important in the design of a task-oriented dialogue system. The proposed benchmark is released together with several baselines to promote more research in this direction."

Our methodology employs a data-driven classification procedure to generate abstract representations of system turns taking into account the previous history of the dialog. A statistical framework is also introduced for the development and evaluation of dialog systems created using the methodology, which is based on a dialog simulation technique. The benefits and flexibility of the proposed methodology have been validated by developing statistical dialog managers for four spoken dialog systems of different complexity, designed for different languages (English, Italian, and Spanish) and application domains (from transactional to problem-solving tasks). The evaluation results show that the proposed methodology allows rapid development of new dialog managers as well as to explore new dialog strategies, which permit developing new enhanced versions of already existing systems."

One recent popular approach is to train end-to-end models on a large amount of real dialog transcripts between humans (Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015). However, this approach leaves many questions unanswered as an understanding of the precise successes and shortcomings of each model is hard to assess. A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015b) which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately, those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work, we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes. Choosing the domain of movies, we provide tasks that test the ability of models to answer factual questions (utilizing OMDB), provide personalization (utilizing MovieLens), carry short conversations about the two, and finally to perform on natural dialogs from Reddit. We provide a dataset covering 75k movie entities and with 3.5M training examples. We present results of various models on these tasks, and evaluate their performance."

A scenario WFST for dialog management was automatically created from an N-gram model of a tag sequence that was annotated in the corpus with Interchange Format (IF). Additionally, a word-to-concept WFST for spoken language understanding (SLU) was obtained from the same corpus. The acquired scenario WFST and SLU WFST were composed together and then optimized. We evaluated the proposed WFST-based statistic dialog management in terms of correctness to detect the next system actions and have confirmed the automatically acquired dialog scenario from a corpus can manage dialog reasonably on the WFST-based dialog management platform."

We used ontologies both as a knowledge base and a basis for the dialogue manager; the knowledge base component and dialogue manager components coalesce in a sense. Domain knowledge is used to track Entities of Interest, i.e. nodes (classes) of the ontology which happen to be products and services. In this way we also introduced conversation memory and attention in a sense. We finely blended linguistic methods, domain-driven keyword ranking and domain ontologies to create ways of domain-driven conversation. Proposed framework is used in our in-house German language banking and finance chatbots.

        "content": "Conversational agents have come increasingly closer to human competence in open-domain dialogue settings; however, such models can reflect insensitive, hurtful, or entirely incoherent viewpoints that erode a user's trust in the moral integrity of the system. Moral deviations are difficult to mitigate because moral judgments are not universal, and there may be multiple competing judgments that apply to a situation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a new resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities, but instead to facilitate systematic understanding of the intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the utterances of dialogue systems. The Moral Integrity Corpus, MIC, is such a resource, which captures the moral assumptions of 38k prompt-reply pairs, using 99k distinct Rules of Thumb (RoTs). Each RoT reflects a particular moral conviction that can explain why a chatbot's reply may appear acceptable or problematic. We further organize RoTs with a set of 9 moral and social attributes and benchmark performance for attribute classification. Most importantly, we show that current neural language models can automatically generate new RoTs that reasonably describe previously unseen interactions, but they still struggle with certain scenarios. Our findings suggest that MIC will be a useful resource for understanding and language models' implicit moral assumptions and flexibly benchmarking the integrity of conversational agents.

Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics."

        "content": "Dialogue systems in the form of chatbots and personal assistants are being increasingly integrated into people's lives. Modern dialogue systems may consider adopting anthropomorphic personas, mimicking societal demographic groups to appear more approachable and trustworthy to users. However, the adoption of a persona can result in the adoption of biases. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on persona biases in dialogue systems and conduct analyses on personas of different social classes, sexual orientations, races, and genders. We define persona biases as harmful differences in responses (e.g., varying levels of offensiveness, agreement with harmful statements) generated from adopting different demographic personas. Furthermore, we introduce an open-source framework, UnitPersonaBias, to explore and aggregate persona biases in dialogue systems. By analyzing the Blender and DialoGPT dialogue systems, we observe that adopting personas can actually decrease harmful responses, compared to not using any personas. Additionally, we find that persona choices can affect the degree of harms in generated responses and thus should be systematically evaluated before deployment. We also analyze how personas can result in different amounts of harm towards specific demographics."

        "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5345904/",
        "content": "The evaluation of conversational dialog systems has remained a controversial topic, as it is challenging to quantitatively assess how well a conversation agent performs, or how much better one is compared to another. Furthermore, one of the hurdles which remains elusive in this quandary is the definition of naturalness, as demonstrated by how well a dialog system can maintain a natural conversation flow devoid of perceived awkwardness. As a step towards defining the dimensions of effectiveness and naturalness in a dialog system, this paper identifies existing evaluation practices which are then expanded to develop a more suitable assessment vehicle. This method is then applied to the LifeLike virtual avatar project."

        "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221002678",
        "content": "Beyond the common difficulties faced in task-oriented dialogue system, medical dialogue has recently attracted increasing attention due to its huge application potential while posing more challenges in reasoning over medical domain knowledge and logic. Existing works resort to neural language models for dialogue embedding and neglect the explicit logical reasoning, leading to poor explainable and generalization ability. In this work, we propose an explainable Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning (HGR) model to unify the relational dialogue context understanding and entity-correlation reasoning into a heterogeneous graph structure. HGR encodes entity context according to the corresponding utterance and deduces next response after fusing the underlying medical knowledge with entity context by attentional graph propagation. To push forward the future research on expert-sensitive task-oriented dialogue system, we first release a large-scale Medical Dialogue Consultant benchmark (MDG-C) with 16 Gastrointestinal diseases for evaluating consultant capability and a Medical Dialogue Diagnosis benchmark (MDG-D) with 6 diseases for measuring diagnosis capability of models, respectively. Extensive experiments on both MDG-C and MDG-D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our HGR over state-of-the-art knowledge grounded approaches in general fields of medical dialogue system."

        "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9165162/",
        "content": "An essential skill for effective communication is the ability to express specific sentiment and emotion in a conversation. Any robust dialogue system should handle the combined effect of both sentiment and emotion while generating responses. This is expected to provide a better experience and concurrently increase users\u2019 satisfaction. Previously, research on either emotion or sentiment controlled dialogue generation has shown great promise in developing the next generation conversational agents, but the simultaneous effect of both is still unexplored. The existing dialogue systems are majorly based on unimodal sources, predominantly the text, and thereby cannot utilize the information present in the other sources, such as video, audio, image, etc. In this article, we present at first a large scale benchmark Sentiment Emotion aware Multimodal Dialogue (SEMD) dataset for the task of sentiment and emotion controlled dialogue generation. The SEMD dataset consists of 55k conversations from 10 TV shows having text, audio, and video information. To utilize multimodal information, we propose multimodal attention based conditional variational autoencoder (M-CVAE) that outperforms several baselines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that multimodality, along with contextual information, plays an essential role in generating coherent and diverse responses for any given emotion and sentiment."

        "content": "Large-scale pre-trained language models have shown impressive results on language understanding benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE, improving considerably over other pre-training methods like distributed representations (GloVe) and purely supervised approaches. We introduce the Dual Intent and Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture, and study the effectiveness of different pre-trained representations on intent and entity prediction, two common dialogue language understanding tasks. DIET advances the state of the art on a complex multi-domain NLU dataset and achieves similarly high performance on other simpler datasets. Surprisingly, we show that there is no clear benefit to using large pre-trained models for this task, and in fact DIET improves upon the current state of the art even in a purely supervised setup without any pre-trained embeddings. Our best performing model outperforms fine-tuning BERT and is about six times faster to train."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07149",
        "content": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin."

The generator is based on recurrent neural networks and the sequence-to-sequence approach. It is fully trainable from data which include preceding context along with responses to be generated. We show that the context-aware generator yields significant improvements over the baseline in both automatic metrics and a human pairwise preference test."

        "content": "A partially observable Markov decision process has been proposed as a dialogue model that enables robustness to speech recognition errors and automatic policy optimisation using reinforcement learning (RL). However, conventional RL algorithms require a very large number of dialogues, necessitating a user simulator. Recently, Gaussian processes have been shown to substantially speed up the optimisation, making it possible to learn directly from interaction with human users. However, early studies have been limited to very low dimensional spaces and the learning has exhibited convergence problems. Here we investigate learning from human interaction using the Bayesian Update of Dialogue State system. This dynamic Bayesian network based system has an optimisation space covering more than one hundred features, allowing a wide range of behaviours to be learned. Using an improved policy model and a more robust reward function, we show that stable learning can be achieved that significantly outperforms a simulator trained policy."

        "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8147343/",
        "content": "We evaluated two strategies for alleviating working memory load for users of voice interfaces: presenting fewer options per turn and providing confirmations. Forty-eight users booked appointments using nine different dialogue systems, which varied in the number of options presented and the confirmation strategy used. Participants also performed four cognitive tests and rated the usability of each dialogue system on a standardised questionnaire. When systems presented more options per turn and avoided explicit confirmation subdialogues, both older and younger users booked appointments more quickly without compromising task success. Users with lower information processing speed were less likely to remember all relevant aspects of the appointment. Working memory span did not affect appointment recall. Older users were slightly less satisfied with the dialogue systems than younger users. We conclude that the number of options is less important than an accurate assessment of the actual cognitive demands of the task at hand."

        "content": "Moving from limited-domain natural language generation (NLG) to open domain is difficult because the number of semantic input combinations grows exponentially with the number of domains. Therefore, it is important to leverage existing resources and exploit similarities between domains to facilitate domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a procedure to train multi-domain, Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN) language generators via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a model is first trained on counterfeited data synthesised from an out-of-domain dataset, and then fine tuned on a small set of in-domain utterances with a discriminative objective function. Corpus-based evaluation results show that the proposed procedure can achieve competitive performance in terms of BLEU score and slot error rate while significantly reducing the data needed to train generators in new, unseen domains. In subjective testing, human judges confirm that the procedure greatly improves generator performance when only a small amount of data is available in the domain."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14306",
        "content": "In recommendation dialogs, humans commonly disclose their preference and make recommendations in a friendly manner. However, this is a challenge when developing a sociable recommendation dialog system, due to the lack of dialog dataset annotated with such sociable strategies. Therefore, we present INSPIRED, a new dataset of 1,001 human-human dialogs for movie recommendation with measures for successful recommendations. To better understand how humans make recommendations in communication, we design an annotation scheme related to recommendation strategies based on social science theories and annotate these dialogs. Our analysis shows that sociable recommendation strategies, such as sharing personal opinions or communicating with encouragement, more frequently lead to successful recommendations. Based on our dataset, we train end-to-end recommendation dialog systems with and without our strategy labels. In both automatic and human evaluation, our model with strategy incorporation outperforms the baseline model. This work is a first step for building sociable recommendation dialog systems with a basis of social science theories."

        "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6163950/",
        "content": "Statistical dialogue models have required a large number of dialogues to optimise the dialogue policy, relying on the use of a simulated user. This results in a mismatch between training and live conditions, and significant development costs for the simulator thereby mitigating many of the claimed benefits of such models. Recent work on Gaussian process reinforcement learning, has shown that learning can be substantially accelerated. This paper reports on an experiment to learn a policy for a real-world task directly from human interaction using rewards provided by users. It shows that a usable policy can be learnt in just a few hundred dialogues without needing a user simulator and, using a learning strategy that reduces the risk of taking bad actions. The paper also investigates adaptation behaviour when the system continues learning for several thousand dialogues and highlights the need for robustness to noisy rewards."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13656",
        "content": "Task-oriented dialogue systems are either modularized with separate dialogue state tracking (DST) and management steps or end-to-end trainable. In either case, the knowledge base (KB) plays an essential role in fulfilling user requests. Modularized systems rely on DST to interact with the KB, which is expensive in terms of annotation and inference time. End-to-end systems use the KB directly as input, but they cannot scale when the KB is larger than a few hundred entries. In this paper, we propose a method to embed the KB, of any size, directly into the model parameters. The resulting model does not require any DST or template responses, nor the KB as input, and it can dynamically update its KB via fine-tuning. We evaluate our solution in five task-oriented dialogue datasets with small, medium, and large KB size. Our experiments show that end-to-end models can effectively embed knowledge bases in their parameters and achieve competitive performance in all evaluated datasets."

Furthermore, a new image-based method is used in Facebook bAbI Task 1 dataset in Out Of Vocabulary setting.
